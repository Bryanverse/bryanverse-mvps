    <h2>What is Memora?</h2>
    <p>Memora’s brand identity is rooted in warmth, intelligence, and trust. Our tone of voice is conversational yet informed, approachable yet insightful — always aiming to build genuine relationships with our users. We exclusively use the Inter typeface for clarity and modern simplicity across all visual and written assets. Our primary color, #4A90E2, conveys dependability and calm innovation. This blue is prominently used in logos, headers, buttons, and highlights to express our tech-forward yet human-focused approach. Supporting colors are selected sparingly to complement this primary hue and maintain a clean, cohesive aesthetic.</p>

    <h2>What is Memora?</h2>
    <p>Memora’s brand voice is friendly, intelligent, and relatable—designed to make users feel both at ease and empowered. We use the Poppins typeface for its clean, modern look that aligns perfectly with our approachable yet tech-savvy personality. Our primary brand color, #6C63FF, is a vibrant periwinkle hue that strikes a balance between innovation and warmth, reinforcing our commitment to making technology feel more human. Text hierarchy should follow a clear and consistent structure, with headings in bold Poppins and body text using regular weight. All communications should maintain clarity, empathy, and a touch of wit when appropriate.</p>

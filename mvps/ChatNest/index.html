      <h2>What is ChatNest?</h2>
      <p>ChatNest’s visual and verbal identity centers on a tone that is warm, intelligent, and personalized—designed to make users feel both at home and empowered by smart technology. We use the Poppins typeface for its clean, modern, yet friendly appeal, ensuring readability and approachability across all devices. Our primary color, #4B8BBE, reflects trust, clarity, and innovation—capturing the perfect balance between professional IT infrastructure and a comforting conversation hub. Tone of voice should always prioritize user empathy, clarity, and intelligent insight, speaking as a trusted guide rather than a generic system.</p>

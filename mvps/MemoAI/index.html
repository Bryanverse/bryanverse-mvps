    <h2>What is MemoAI?</h2>
    <p>MemoAI‚Äôs brand voice is friendly, insightful, and personal‚Äîdesigned to foster trust through clarity and warmth. Our communications aim to spark curiosity while making users feel genuinely understood. We use the Inter font family for its modern, clean, and highly legible form, providing a seamless experience across digital interfaces. Color-wise, MemoAI is anchored by our signature purple (#6C5CE7), which conveys creativity, intelligence, and approachability. This core color should be used prominently in buttons, headings, and key visual elements, with ample white space and soft neutrals to balance and spotlight key content.</p>
